<h5 class="card-title">Who is Marked Souls</h5>  
<p class="card-text">Marked Souls is a North American based online gaming community which was originally created in 2007 as a
Guild Wars guild. Marked Souls is primarily a PvE guild. You can expect guild missions, events, raids, etc.</p>
<h5 class="card-title">What makes an ideal Marked Souls member?</h5>
<p class="card-text">An ideal recruit has a good sense of humor and enjoys playing with other guild members.
Weâ€™re looking for members of any experience level that want to work with the guild to complete any and all
content we face.</p>
<p class="card-text">In Marked Souls, participation in the community counts for a lot more than your current
skill at the game. We have experienced players willing to work with players that feel they need help in a
specific area (game mode, class, etc.).</p>
